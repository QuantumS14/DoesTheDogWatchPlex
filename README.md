[![Download DoesTheDogWatchPlex](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Here-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/QuantumS14/DoesTheDogWatchPlex/releases)

## 📖 What is DoesTheDogWatchPlex?

DoesTheDogWatchPlex adds content warnings from DoesTheDogDie.com directly to your Plex library. It helps you know if movies or shows contain scenes that might be upsetting to some viewers. This includes warnings about animals in danger, distressing situations, or sensitive content involving pets.

The app works quietly in the background and flags your Plex media with these content alerts. This way, you can decide what to watch with your family or friends knowing which movies could have difficult scenes. It supports movies and TV shows in your Plex media server.

## 💻 Requirements

Before you start, make sure your system meets these basic requirements:

- A computer running Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.13 or later, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 or newer)
- Plex Media Server installed and running on your device or network
- Internet connection to download data from DoesTheDogDie.com
- At least 100 MB of free disk space for the application and cached data

DoesTheDogWatchPlex is designed to work smoothly on most home computers. If you use a NAS (Network Attached Storage) with Plex, make sure it supports running third-party apps on your device.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get DoesTheDogWatchPlex up and running with your Plex server.

### 1. Download the app

First, you need to download DoesTheDogWatchPlex. Click the big button at the top or visit the link below:

[Download DoesTheDogWatchPlex](https://github.com/QuantumS14/DoesTheDogWatchPlex/releases)

This will take you to the official releases page on GitHub, where you can find the latest version available for your operating system.

### 2. Choose your file

On the releases page, scroll to the latest release and find the download link for your platform:

- For Windows, look for a file ending with `.exe`
- For macOS, look for a `.dmg` or `.zip` file
- For Linux, look for `.AppImage` or `.tar.gz`

Click the appropriate link to download the installer or app archive.

### 3. Install the app

- On **Windows**: Run the `.exe` file and follow the setup wizard. It will guide you through the installation steps.
- On **macOS**: Open the `.dmg` or unzip the archive, then drag the app to your Applications folder.
- On **Linux**: Make the `.AppImage` executable by right-clicking and selecting “Properties,” then “Allow executing file as program.” Or extract the `.tar.gz` and run the app binary inside.

### 4. Connect to Plex

Open DoesTheDogWatchPlex after installation. The first time you run the app, it will ask you to log into your Plex account or enter your Plex server address. This step lets the app access your media library to add content warnings.

Enter the requested information carefully. If you don’t know your Plex server address, check your Plex Media Server settings or visit https://app.plex.tv/ to find it.

### 5. Let the app scan your library

After connecting to Plex, DoesTheDogWatchPlex will scan your movies and TV shows for titles that appear on DoesTheDogDie.com. This process might take a few minutes depending on how many files you have.

Once done, content warnings will show up in your Plex interface or as a separate list inside the app, depending on the settings.

## 🛠 How It Works

DoesTheDogWatchPlex links your Plex media titles to the DoesTheDogDie.com database. This website tracks movies and TV shows that might include animal death or distress scenes. 

The app pulls this data and adds warning icons or notes to your Plex library items:

- Shows a small animal icon for flagged movies
- Provides details on what type of warning applies (e.g., dog death, animal abuse, distress scenes)
- Lets you filter your library to show only titles with or without warnings

The integration helps you avoid surprises or prepare for sensitive moments before playing a movie or episode.

## ⚙ Settings and Preferences

You can customize how DoesTheDogWatchPlex works for you:

- **Auto-Scan Frequency:** Choose how often the app updates its database and rescans your library (daily, weekly, manual).
- **Warning Types:** Pick which content warnings you want to see. For example, show only animal death warnings or include general distress.
- **Display Options:** Toggle between showing warnings as icons in Plex or viewing them inside the app.
- **Notifications:** Enable desktop notifications when a new flagged title is added to your library.

Adjust these settings from the app’s Preferences or Settings menu.

## 💡 Tips for Using DoesTheDogWatchPlex

- Run the app after adding new movies or shows to Plex to keep your warnings up to date.
- Use the filter feature when choosing movies for family movie night.
- Browse the DoesTheDogDie.com website for detailed descriptions of flagged titles.
- Keep your Plex Media Server and DoesTheDogWatchPlex app updated to prevent connection issues.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

If the app does not connect to your Plex server:

- Make sure Plex Media Server is running and accessible on your network
- Check your firewall or antivirus settings; the app needs permission to communicate with Plex
- Verify your Plex login or server address are correct
- Restart the app and Plex server if needed

If warnings do not appear:

- Confirm the app has finished scanning your library
- Check that your titles are correctly named and matched in Plex
- Update the app to the latest version
